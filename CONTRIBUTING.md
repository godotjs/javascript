## Project Structure

## Documentation

This project uses [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to serve all docs. You can change the documentation inside the ``docs`` folder. 
To add new pages you need to update ``mkdocs.yml``.

## Preparing your PR

The project is using [``clang-format``](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format most files. You need to run `bash ./clang_format.sh` before your PR for a successful pipeline.
